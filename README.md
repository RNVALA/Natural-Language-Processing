# Natural-Language-Processing
### What is Natural Language Processing
#### Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the interactions between computers and human languages. It involves teaching computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language using machine learning algorithms.

#### The goal of NLP is to enable machines to understand and interpret human language, and to produce language that humans can understand. This involves various tasks such as natural language understanding, natural language generation, machine translation, sentiment analysis, speech recognition, and text summarization, among others.
